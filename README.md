# volcal_baseline_android

An Android client for interacting with the [`volcal_baseline`](https://github.com/deemoe404/volcal_baseline) pipeline via the [`volcal_baseline_server`](https://github.com/deemoe404/volcal_baseline_server) web service.  
The `volcal_baseline` system provides a **data-driven pipeline for large-scale open-pit mine excavation monitoring** based on multi-temporal 3D point clouds.

This mobile application enables field users to submit point cloud data, monitor processing progress, and review excavation change resultsâ€”**directly from Android embedded devices**, including DJI remote controllers and other edge-computing platforms.
